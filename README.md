## Data Collection

**Requirements:** `python-twitter`, `unicodecsv`

`$ pip install python-twitter`
`$ pip install unicodecsv`

**Get started**

Go to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com) and get a consumer key and access token. Then, create a file in the data-collection directory called config.py. Fill that file with the following:

```python
consumer_key = "{YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY}"
consumer_secret = "{YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET}"
access_token = "{YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
access_token_secret = "{YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET}"
```

Save that file and you're all set to go! Now you can run the scripts at will.
