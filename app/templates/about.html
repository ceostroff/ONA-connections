	<p>This app was created by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/charliersmart">Charlie Smart</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tallbrighty">Aaron Albright</a> as part of the 2016 ONA Student Newsroom. Conference attendees are based on a <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ONAConf/lists/attendees-at-ona16">Twitter list</a> created by the Online News Association. Data was scraped from Twitter using Python at 9 a.m. on Friday, September 16. The app is largely JavaScript based, with a <a target="_blank" href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> back end and a healthy dose of <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a>.</p>
